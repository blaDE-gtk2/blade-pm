.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBblade-pm-settings\fP is a utility that comes with the Xfce4
power manager to access/change its configuration.  It is a separate program
that uses blconf to load/save settings according to the user's choices.
\fBblade-pm-settings\fP requires the Xfce4 power manager to be
running because it connects to it via DBus and gets information about which
settings should and should not be displayed; for  example,  the
\fBblade-pm-settings\fP utility will not show the LCD brightness
settings if no device was detected by the running instance of the Xfce4 power
manager.

You can run \fBblade-pm-settings\fP from the command line without
